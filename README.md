- 👋 Hi, I’m Sabina!
- 👀 My hobbies involve art, piano, hiking, gaming, programming and my dog.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me grow as a programmer!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked in the game industry as a concept artist!
I love how creativity and programming compliment each other :)
